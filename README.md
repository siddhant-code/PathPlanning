# ENPM661 - Planning for Autonomous Robots - Projects

## Project-2:

This project implements BFS and Dijkstra's algorithm for path planning a point robot in a 2D workspace with obstacles. The obstacles are represented by the text "ENPM661" with a clearance of 2mm.

You can access them through the folders [bfs](../PathPlanning/path_planning_algorithms/bfs/) and [dijkstra](../PathPlanning/path_planning_algorithms/dijkstra/)


## Project-3:

This project implements A* Algorithm to find a path between the start and end point on a given map for a mobile robot.

You can access the project files through the folder [astar](https://github.com/siddhant-code/PathPlanning/tree/main/path_planning_algorithms/astar)
